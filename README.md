# Final Project - OOP
For the final project, you need to create a system in which you need 3 super classes and 9 child classes. As we've learned, you must use abstraction, interfaces, polymorfism, a database and other principals known in OOP (such as overloading, overcharging, arraylist, etc.).

I decided that I would programm a system in which you have employees that are divided on their areas, adminstration, developers and managers. Then the child classes would be:

### Administration:
- Assistant
- Accountant
- Receptionist

### Developers:
- Fullstack
- Backend
- Frontend

### Managers:
- Human Resources
- Project Managers
- General Manager
